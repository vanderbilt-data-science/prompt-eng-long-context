The Interrelations of Knowledge and Will 
Erda, Experience, and Epistemology in the Ring 
lisa feurzeig 
Erda, the sleeping earth goddess of knowledge, is often relegated to the background of Ring interpretations; the commentary about her is fre­quently as vague as her own prophecies. By comparison with her daughter, Brünnhilde, she is arguably less vital and unquestionably less involved in world events—which she foresees but in which she rarely participates. By the end of the cycle, when Brünnhilde is on center stage, Erda has slipped away into a dou­ble oblivion: not only entirely disconnected from world events but also prob­ably forgotten by most of the audience. 
Natural though it may be—and I explore the reasons for this below—our obliviousness to Erda deprives us of some signi.cant insights into the world of the Ring. She plays the roles of both goddess and mother, and in each of those capacities she has something to teach us. As goddess of knowledge, Erda reveals much about epistemological concepts in the Ring, particularly through the con­trast between her .rst and second onstage appearances. As mother of Brünn­hilde, she partakes in the remarkable parallelisms that Wagner arranges between his older and younger generations. Just as Siegfried’s decisions and mistakes may be compared with those of Wotan, Brünnhilde’s history may very fruit­fully be compared with Erda’s; the parallels are clearest when one considers the sexual relationships of Wotan with Erda and Siegfried with Brünnhilde. While these two pairings diVer in one very important respect—the presence or absence of love—the ways in which they balance knowledge and power share a com­mon trajectory. 
A typical presumption in most of the all-too-brief commentaries on Erda is that she is unchanging: whatever she is and represents in Das Rheingold must therefore remain the case in Siegfried.1 I shall argue, on the contrary, that Erda’s position and capabilities change between her two onstage appearances—not because she herself has changed but because the world is being transformed around her. Erda’s two scenes diVer in three signi.cant ways. In Das Rheingold

she comes of her own accord to share her superior knowledge; both her words and her music clearly dominate the scene, as Wotan’s submissive attitude reveals. In Siegfried, she is summoned against her will by Wotan; his knowledge of world events is superior to hers and when the two gods clash verbally and musi­cally, their control of the scene is much more nearly equal.2

Epistemology is the branch of philosophy that considers questions about knowledge. How do we know that something is true? Are there diVerent ways of knowing and diVerent levels of certitude? We need not concern ourselves here with how philosophers answer these questions about the world we actu­ally inhabit but rather simply observe how these matters work in the .ctional world of the Ring cycle. 
Characters in the Ring draw their knowledge or, more skeptically speaking, their beliefs, from four main sources: 
(1)
 direct experience: Sieglinde watches as Siegmund is killed, and therefore she knows that he is dead. 

(2)
 being told: Brünnhilde believes that Wotan is the father of the Wälsung twins because he tells her; Siegfried believes that Mime wants to kill him be­cause the Forest Bird tells him. 

(3)
 inward sense: Siegmund and Sieglinde are strangely drawn together, feel a kinship, see and hear physical resemblance, and realize that they are brother and sister. (This knowledge also depends on their awareness that each of them was separated from a twin in childhood, but that fact is clearly not enough to “prove” in any way that they are each other’s twin.) 


(4) dreams: Erda’s dreams predict coming world events. 
A full consideration of knowledge in the Ring is far beyond the scope of this essay. Carolyn Abbate has approached one aspect of Ring epistemology by ask­ing whether Wotan’s narration to Brünnhilde is truthful; in so doing, she also challenges the truth of what the Ring’s music narrates by referring to leitmo­tifs.3 As I examine Erda’s two scenes, I direct attention to the con.ict between her dream-knowledge and the knowledge Wotan gains from experience. While my argument proceeds somewhat diVerently from Abbate’s, I join her in re.ect­ing on how the music of the Ring in.uences our judgments as listeners. Wotan’s way of learning, I claim, captures our sympathy for two reasons. First, it is more like our own human experiences than Erda’s absolute knowledge; second, it is akin to the musical principles on which the Ring is built. In other words, both our own lives and Wagner’s music implicitly privilege Wotan’s perspective. 
Erda’s First Appearance 
When Erda .rst appears near the conclusion of Das Rheingold, Wotan’s evident ignorance does much to diminish his authority. How can the king of the gods 
be unaware of the existence of such a goddess? He consults nightly with the Norns (as Erda reminds him), yet he has apparently never known that they have a mother and that the information they convey comes directly from her dreams. Only because of the present high stakes does Erda now appear in person (“Doch höchste Gefahr führt mich heut’ selbst zu dir her”) to warn Wotan not to keep the ring.4 Further, she tells him of trouble ahead: “Alles was ist, endet! Ein düstrer Tag dämmert den Göttern” [All that is, ends! A gloomy day dawns for the gods].5 Her appearance serves the drama in two ways: in the short term, she convinces Wotan to relinquish the ring, and in the long term, she awakens him to the possibility of trouble—teaches him fear, to use a phrase later applied to Siegfried—thus fueling his actions in the next two operas and his eventual acceptance of the gods’ destruction. 
Until this moment, Wotan has been active, ambitious, and impetuous—he is still a young god. Erda, by contrast, is timeless and impassive; her tasks are to predict and record, and her decision to warn Wotan is the closest she has ever come to action. Wotan is, above all, a being with a will; Erda is a neutral prophetess. Yet by a curious reversal, it is the will-less Erda who has the power in this scene, by virtue of her knowledge. The value of that knowledge is evident from Wotan’s wild attempt to prevent her from leaving. 
What kind of knowledge does Erda represent? In her own words, she knows “wie alles war . . . wie alles wird, wie alles sein wird” [how all was . . . how all is becoming, how all will be]. More simply stated, she claims knowledge of the past, present, and future, describing the present as a process rather than a state; each of the three Norns is responsible for one of these. Erda might be described as the goddess of history, she who sees the four-dimensional whole. As such, she brings up a standard philosophical question: what roles do fate and free will play in determining world events? Her arrival to warn Wotan against the ring seems to indicate that actions in the present can make some kind of diVerence, yet on the other hand, her warning that all will end leaves no room for change.6 The entire Ring cycle will show that while the fact of the end was inevitable, its meaning was yet to be determined. But I anticipate; in Das Rheingold none of that is clear. For Wotan, Erda is important because she knows facts, and she may also know which of those facts are .xed and which might be changeable. As king of the gods, he needs this information, and Erda’s departure gives him a reason to .nd her again later. 
The music reveals Erda’s control of this scene from the start. She rises out of her rocky cleft into an angry quarrel among the gods, as Wotan is refusing to relinquish the ring even to save Fricka from the giants. The orchestra’s ascend­ing and descending F-minor arpeggios (see ex. 1), which seem to stand for Wotan’s de.ance, are interrupted. Like Erda herself, the interruption is slow and inexorable, in contrast to the rushing violence of the gods’ quarrel. Her­alded in the score by a striking change of key signature (from three .ats to four sharps), a new motive slowly makes itself heard. The low C in the bass line is replaced by a held C-sharp that becomes the .rst note of Erda’s motive, a minor-mode version of the Nature motive.

For much of this brief scene, the orchestra plays Erda’s two-measure wave­like motive and its variations. Above this regularity, Erda’s own melodies move freely in irregular phrases, her thoughts often punctuated by rests. In example 2, she sings in a pattern that happens to fall into units of 3 + 3 + 2 measures, but her declaimed melody seems to exist outside preimposed metrical units. Her .rst phrase begins halfway through a held chord in the orchestra, and the orchestra then begins to cycle through two-measure units. In this eight-measure passage, Erda never begins a phrase together with the orchestra—yet despite the independence of vocal and orchestral events, instruments and voice are tightly interwoven. That the orchestra represents Erda’s consciousness seems unquestionable, for it consistently plays motives appropriate to her words: the Nature theme as she mentions the primordial Norns, the theme of Woe as she speaks of danger, and the Ring theme when she warns Wotan not to keep the ring. These musical associations underpin Erda’s claim to superior knowledge, showing that she is fully aware of world events including even the most recent ones.7 
In this scene, Wotan’s primary action is listening. Erda’s arrival and warning lead to an instant change in his attitude, from de.ant anger to fascinated sub­mission. He interrupts Erda only twice, and both of his remarks re.ect her dominance. First, when he asks Erda who she is (see ex. 2), he falls into her key, joining the orchestra on a dominant seventh of C-sharp minor. By outlining a second-inversion triad, which can never conclude a phrase, his melody re.ects his questioning spirit and submissive attitude. Second, after Erda’s prophecy, as Wotan begs her to stay and explain the mysteries she has hinted at, his melody

reenacts Erda’s appearance. (Compare example 1 with the opening of example 3.) At that moment, we recall, a C-natural was replaced by a C-sharp. Wotan’s melody begins with the same four pitches as that orchestral passage, although the C-natural is respelled as B-sharp in order to .t into the dominant seventh chord. His perhaps unconscious echoing of Erda’s theme demonstrates how deeply enthralled he is by her pronouncement (“geheimnisshehr hallt mir dein Wort”). 
Erda’s eVect on the newly fearful god is symbolized by the chord that lingers as she disappears: an A major triad made uneasy by a residual G-sharp persist­ing in the lower register. That note does not function as a seventh, but as the dominant of Erda’s key; its continued presence suggests that Wotan will not escape the thoughts she has left behind. (See the .nal measure of example 3.) 
We must appreciate just how strong Erda is in this encounter in order to comprehend the magnitude of the change she will undergo. In Das Rheingold, Wotan is a young god, and the audience too is in its formative stages. As he grows in knowledge and understanding, the audience works its way into the

story and music of these operas. He and we will change together, and when Erda next appears, we will see her diVerently. 
Interlude 
Signi.cant events transpire between Erda’s two scenes. Wotan seeks Erda out in her own realm, where he gains more of her knowledge and also makes her pregnant. Their daughter, Brünnhilde, is raised by her father as a Valkyrie and later punished for her de.ance by being made mortal.8 We do not know what the oVstage encounter between Wotan and Erda is really like, for their memo­ries of it are very diVerent. Erda describes it as follows: “Mich Wissende selbst bezwang ein Waltender einst” [I myself, the knowing one, was once conquered by a ruler]. While Wotan’s version retains the elements of force and the taking of knowledge, as he tells Brünnhilde of her origins, he speaks also of love: “Mit Liebeszauber zwang ich die Wala, stört ihres Wissens Stolz” [With love-magic I forced the Wala, disturbed her proud knowledge]. 
This encounter, it is worth noting, is one of Erda’s only two direct experi­ences, the other being her intervention in Das Rheingold. Since that time—while Wotan has experienced love aVairs and battles, raised a son and then killed him, argued with his wife, punished his intransigent but beloved daughter, and bat­tled to gain the control of world events that he once expected to win easily— Erda has been sleeping. Aside from the few vivid moments of reality, her view of the world must resemble the experience of someone watching an epic movie, who knows herself, no matter how strong her reactions, to be essentially sepa­rate from the action and immune to its consequences. 
We listeners have also changed since Erda’s Rheingold appearance. In the interim, we have heard all of Die Walküre and the .rst two acts of Siegfried. Our ears are attuned to the Ring’s textures, styles, and motives. Not only are we familiar with many motives, we have also learned to hear them in complex con­texts that depend on the situations in which they have been heard before and on how they are combined each time they recur. We understand the story in more than two dimensions, because the music is constantly drawing nonlinear con­nections. In short, we have become insiders; we see and hear from within Wag­ner’s Ring paradigm. We can still be critics—for instance, we do not have to like Wotan or .nd the music beautiful—but we do so from the insider’s point of view. In the Siegfried scene, we will discover that Erda, in her dream-world, has somehow slipped oV the track of the Ring’s universe. As we became insid­ers, the world changed around Erda, and she is now less a part of things than we are. 
Erda’s Last Stand 
As the third act of Siegfried opens, Wotan—known in this opera as the Wan-derer—calls Erda from her sleep to ask for her counsel. When she refers him to Brünnhilde for information, he tells her of how Brünnhilde has been punished with the loss of her godhead. In the course of these revelations, Erda recog­nizes him and accuses him of Meineid (perjury). Angry at his betrayal, she wants to return immediately to the refuge of indiVerent sleep, but he does not release her until he has told her of his world plan and his acceptance of the end of the gods. 
The above sketch is overly simple, for in this scene both characters are change­able and their motives diYcult to fathom. Wotan hails Erda as the all-knowing woman, but in the course of the scene it is he who gives her apparently new information, and not vice versa. He asks her, metaphorically, how to avert the gods’ downfall (“wie zu hemmen ein rollendes Rad”), but then goes on to announce that he gladly embraces it. Still clothed in the trappings of knowledge, Erda nevertheless describes her own confusion (“Wirr wird mir seit ich erwacht”) and seems to need time to process the strange news Wotan brings. Her attitude changes during the scene as she moves from impassivity to indignation. In this scene, both characters are being transformed. Gösta Neuwirth comes to terms with the scene’s musical subtleties by postulating that they express a diVerence between who Erda really is and the way Wotan imagines her to be (in Neuwirth’s terms, the “Erda-model” and Wotan’s “Erda­projection”).9 
I touch on three aspects of this scene: its relation to Wagner’s Eddic source materials, its balance between mythological and psychological realms, and its musical language. Then I point out some parallels between the relationship of Wotan and Erda, which comes to an end here, and that of Siegfried and Brünnhilde, which has its beginning in the following scene. In doing so, I also re.ect on what such parallels signify: are they simply a clever literary device, or do they have something more to impart?
